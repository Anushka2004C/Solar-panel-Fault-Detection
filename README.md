In recent years, the world has been moving rapidly toward renewable energy sources to combat climate change, reduce carbon emissions, and ensure long-term sustainability. Among these, solar energy has become one of the most widely adopted and promising sources of clean power.
However, solar panels are prone to various physical and environmental faults such as dusty,clean,bird-drop,snow-covered etc .These faults significantly reduce the efficiency of power generation and increase maintenance costs. Often, these problems go undetected for long periods because manual inspection of large solar farms is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly.
With the increasing global demand for sustainable energy, it has become crucial to develop an automated and intelligent fault detection system that can quickly and accurately identify defective solar panels. By leveraging deep learning and image classification techniques, we can build an efficient, real-time monitoring system that helps improve solar panel performance and contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy.
The dataset used in this project is the Solar Panel Fault Detection Dataset collected from Kaggle  .It contains labeled images of Normal  and Defective solar panels, including faults like cracks, dust, shadows, . All images were resized, normalized, and augmented before training to improve model performance and ensure accurate fault detection.
